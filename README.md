# Hospital-Data-Analysis
For the hospital data analysis project using Power BI, I performed data cleaning and created several calculated columns using DAX functions. The metrics analyzed include:

Total Patients: 25 million
Average Number of Patients per Period: 54.40
Waiting List (Last Month): 709,000
Patient List (Past Year): 640,000
I then developed a dashboard to visualize these insights effectively
